# libft

To use the library, you will need to compile it into a static library file (.a). This can be done by running the make command in the project directory. This will compile all the necessary files and create the libft.a file in the same directory.

The library contains a wide variety of functions, including:

* ft_atoi: Converts a string to an integer.
* ft_bzero: Sets a block of memory to zero.
* ft_calloc: Allocates memory and sets it to zero.
* ft_isalnum: Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
* ft_isalpha: Checks if a character is alphabetic.
* ft_isascii: Checks if a character is an ASCII character.
* ft_isdigit: Checks if a character is a digit.
* ft_isprint: Checks if a character is printable.
* ft_itoa: Converts an integer to a string.
* ft_memccpy: Copies memory until a specific character is found.
* ft_memchr: Searches a block of memory for a specific character.
* ft_memcmp: Compares two blocks of memory.
* ft_memcpy: Copies a block of memory.
* ft_memmove: Copies a block of memory, handling overlapping memory blocks.
* ft_memset: Sets a block of memory to a specific value.
* ft_putchar_fd: Writes a character to a file descriptor.
* ft_putendl_fd: Writes a string, followed by a newline, to a file descriptor.
* ft_putnbr_fd: Writes an integer to a file descriptor.
* ft_putstr_fd: Writes a string to a file descriptor.
* ft_split: Splits a string into an array of strings, based on a delimiter.
* ft_strchr: Searches a string for a specific character.
* ft_strdup: Duplicates a string.
* ft_strjoin: Concatenates two strings.
* ft_strlcat: Concatenates two strings, ensuring that the output is always null-terminated.
* ft_strlcpy: Copies a string, ensuring that the output is always null-terminated.
* ft_strlen: Calculates the length of a string.
* ft_strmapi: Applies a function to each character in a string.
* ft_strncmp: Compares two strings, up to a specified number of characters.
* ft_strnstr: Searches a string for a substring.
* ft_strrchr: Searches a string for a specific character, starting from the end.
* ft_strtrim: Removes specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.
* ft_substr: Extracts a substring from a string.

In addition to these functions, there are also several functions for working with linked lists.
